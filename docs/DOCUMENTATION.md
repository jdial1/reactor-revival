# Reactor Revival: Complete Game Documentation

Welcome to the Reactor Revival documentation. This document provides comprehensive information about the game's architecture, data management, game mechanics, and UI/UX specifications.

## 1. System and Architecture

### 1.1. Overview
Reactor Revival is a modern, browser-based incremental game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The architecture emphasizes modularity, performance, and maintainability through clear separation of concerns and data-driven design.

### 1.2. Core Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design:** Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility, promoting high cohesion and loose coupling. Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded.
- **Performance Optimization:** The system prioritizes efficient DOM updates, proper memory management, and preloading of critical assets to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Data-Driven Design:** All game content, from parts to objectives, is externalized into JSON files. This allows for easy modification and scaling without changing core game logic. [1]

### 1.3. Module Architecture
The architecture is a modular, event-driven system composed of three distinct layers:

#### 1.3.1. Core Logic Layer (`public/src/core/`)
-   **StateManager.js**: The single source of truth for all game state (e.g., `current_money`, `current_heat`, `protium_particles`, `pause`). It uses an observer pattern to notify subscribers of changes and is the only module authorized to directly mutate state.
-   **Game.js**: The central orchestrator. It provides a public API for high-level actions (`reboot_action`, `sell_action`) and delegates tasks to other core modules. It does not hold its own state.
-   **Engine.js**: Manages the main game loop (tick), delegating per-tick operations to specialized subsystems. It implements performance optimizations like part categorization and caching.
-   **HeatManager.js**: A dedicated subsystem to handle all heat transfer logic, abstracting this complexity away from the main `Engine`.
-   **PartSet.js / UpgradeSet.js**: Manages the collections of all available parts and upgrades, handling creation, retrieval, and global state updates (e.g., affordability checks).

#### 1.3.2. UI Layer (`public/src/components/`)
-   **UI.js**: The primary UI manager. It subscribes to the `StateManager` and orchestrates DOM updates in response to state changes.
-   **PageRouter.js**: Handles navigation between game screens (Reactor, Upgrades, Research), loading and unloading page-specific components.
-   **Page Components (`*Page.js`)**: Encapsulated components for each major UI view, built from HTML templates.

#### 1.3.3. Services Layer (`public/src/services/`)
-   **dataService.js**: A centralized service for fetching and caching all game content from JSON files.
-   **GoogleDriveSave.js**: Encapsulates all logic for interacting with the Google Drive API for cloud saves.

## 2. Data and Content Management

### 2.1. Overview
All game content is externalized into JSON files to create a data-driven architecture. The `dataService` is responsible for loading, caching, and validating this data at runtime.

### 2.2. Handling Large Numbers
To prevent precision loss with numbers exceeding `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (~9e15), any such value **must be stored as a string** in the JSON files. The `dataService` automatically parses these into `BigInt` for precise calculations.

-   **Standard:** Store large numbers as full numeric strings (e.g., `"1000000000000000000"`), not in scientific notation.
-   **Scope:** Applies to fields like `base_cost`, `reward_money`, `power_output`, `heat_output`, etc.

### 2.3. Data File Specifications

    -   **Cells:** `power_output`, `heat_output`, `base_ticks`, and associated multipliers and upgrade costs.
    -   **Reflectors:** `power_boost`, `heat_boost`, `base_ticks`, and multipliers.
    -   **Cooling Parts:** `base_vent`, `base_transfer` (string), `base_containment` (string), and multipliers.
    -   **Capacity Parts:** `base_reactor_power`, `base_reactor_heat`, and multipliers.
    -   **Accelerators:** `ep_generation` and multipliers.
-   **Experimental Fields (Optional):** `experimental` (boolean), `experimental_level`, `experimental_erequires`, `experimental_cost` (string), and stat overrides.

#### 2.3.2. `upgrade_list.json`
An array of upgrade templates.
-   **Required Fields:** `id`, `type`, `title`, `description`, `icon` (full path from `/public`), `multiplier`.
-   **Cost Fields (One Required):** `cost` (string, for Money) or `ecost` (string, for EP).
-   **Optional Fields:** `actionId`, `prerequisite`, `erequires`, `levels`.

#### 2.3.3. `objective_list.json`
An array of objective definitions.
-   **Required Fields:** `id`, `title`, `checkId`.
-   **Reward Fields (At Least One Required):** `reward_money` (string, optional) or `reward_ep` (number, optional).
-   **Optional Fields:** `description`, `prerequisite`.

Objects containing UI text strings for tooltips, messages, and structured in-game help content.

## 3. Critical Game Mechanics

### 3.1. Heat Management System

#### 3.1.1. Overview
Heat is a core mechanic, existing in two forms: **Component Heat** (stored in a Part) and **Reactor Heat** (global). A dedicated `HeatManager` simulates heat transfer between adjacent components.

#### 3.1.2. Heat Transfer
Heat transfer follows a deterministic algorithm:
1.  **Heat Segments**: Components connected via heat transfer paths form segments.
2.  **Conservation**: Within a segment, heat is moved, not created or destroyed.
3.  **Flow Direction**: Heat only flows from hotter to cooler components.
4.  **Limits**: Transfer is limited by the `transfer` capacity of components, and a component cannot absorb more heat than its remaining `containment`.

#### 3.1.3. Auto Heat Reduction
-   **Mechanism:** A unified heat reduction mechanism is controlled by the `reactor.heat_controlled` boolean property.
-   **Control:** This is enabled via the "Heat Control Operator" upgrade. When `true`, reactor heat is reduced each tick by the formula: `(reactor.max_heat / 10000) * vent_multiplier`.
-   **Independence:** This auto-reduction is independent of and unaffected by the presence of Heat Outlets.

#### 3.1.4. Heat-to-Power Scaling (Overpressure Fission)
The power bonus from the 'Overpressure Fission' upgrade is **critical for game balance** and uses **logarithmic scaling** to prevent exponential feedback loops at high heat.
-   **Correct Formula (Logarithmic):**
    ```javascript
    tile.power *= 1 + (this.heat_power_multiplier * (Math.log(this.current_heat) / Math.log(1000) / 100));
    ```
-   **Warning:** Any "simplification" to a linear formula will break game progression and must be avoided. This is enforced by the `tests/core/heat-power-scaling.test.js` test suite.

#### 3.1.5. Reactor Meltdown
A full reactor meltdown occurs if `current_heat` exceeds 200% of `max_heat`. This destroys all parts, stops the game engine, and restricts navigation.

### 3.2. Valve System
Valves are special components for advanced heat management, organized into three distinct groups.

#### 3.2.1. Group 1: Overflow Valves
-   **Purpose:** High-pressure relief to prevent component explosions.
-   **Activation:** Activates when an **input** component's heat exceeds **80%** of its containment.
-   **Transfer Direction:** Input → Output.

#### 3.2.2. Group 2: Top-up Valves
-   **Purpose:** Low-level maintenance to maintain minimum heat levels.
-   **Activation:** Activates when an **output** component's heat drops below **20%** of its containment.
-   **Transfer Direction:** Input → Output.

#### 3.2.3. Group 3: Check Valves
-   **Purpose:** Enforce one-way heat flow.
-   **Activation:** Always active.
-   **Transfer Direction:** Input → Output (unidirectional).

### 3.3. Part Mechanics
-   **Lifespan & Degradation:** Parts with finite lifespans (e.g., Cells, Reflectors) degrade over time. Their effectiveness (power, heat, bonuses) is proportional to their remaining ticks.
-   **Protium Cell Bonus:** The "Protium Cell" provides a persistent, stacking power bonus. When its lifespan ends, a global `protium_particles` counter is incremented, boosting the power of all current and future Protium Cells.
-   **Exotic Particle Generation:** Particle Accelerators generate Exotic Particles (EP), a prestige currency, based on the amount of heat transferred through them.

### 3.4. Save/Load System
The game state is serializable to JSON for saving to Local Storage or Google Drive.
-   **Identified Issue:** The `heat_controlled` state is correctly saved but is not restored when loading a game. This requires a fix in the `applySaveState` method.

## 4. UI/UX Specification

### 4.1. UI Principles
-   **Clarity:** Game state (Money, Power, Heat) is always visible and easily understood.
-   **Responsive Design:** The UI adapts seamlessly from mobile (portrait) to desktop (landscape) layouts.
-   **Immediate Feedback:** Player actions provide immediate visual or auditory feedback.
-   **Data-Driven UI:** UI elements are dynamically generated from external JSON data files.

### 4.2. Layout and Flow
-   **Navigation:** A persistent top bar (desktop >900px) or bottom bar (mobile <=900px) allows navigation between **Reactor**, **Upgrades**, and **Research** screens.
-   **Panels:** A **Parts Panel** allows component selection. An **Info Bar** displays critical stats. An **Objectives Bar** shows the current objective.

### 4.3. Key Component Requirements
-   **Parts & Upgrades Panels:** Dynamically display all purchasable items from data files. Buttons must visually indicate their affordability state (e.g., grayscale). Unaffordable items remain clickable to show a tooltip.
-   **Reactor Grid:** Visually represents the `Tileset`, showing placed parts and their condition (lifespan, heat) via status bars.
-   **Visual Feedback:** The UI provides clear warnings for rising heat (glowing grid) and meltdowns (screen-wide effect). Objective completions trigger a visual flash.

## 5. Asset Management
A comprehensive asset management strategy is in place to optimize performance.

-   **High-Resolution Assets Exception:** PWA icons (e.g., `cell_1_1-192x192.png`, `cell_1_1-512x512.png`) are maintained as individual files for manifests, favicons, and app store listings.
-   **Best Practices:** Avoid hardcoding image paths in component code. Use descriptive names for CSS classes and monitor loading times after changes. Individual images are maintained as fallbacks for development.

## 6. Requirements

### 6.1. Functional Requirements (FR)
-   **FR-GRID:** The game features a 12x12 grid, expandable to 32x35, where players place, sell, and copy/paste parts.
-   **FR-PART:** Parts (Cells, Reflectors, Capacitors, Cooling, etc.) are defined by external data and have unique mechanics.
-   **FR-HEAT:** Heat exists in component and reactor forms, with a meltdown occurring at 200% max heat.
-   **FR-UPGRADE:** The system supports Standard (Money) and Experimental (EP) upgrades defined in data files.
-   **FR-OBJECTIVE:** A linear series of objectives with defined completion criteria and rewards.
-   **FR-SAVE:** Game state is serializable to JSON for Local Storage and optional Google Drive saving.

### 6.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
-   **NFR-PERF:** The game engine must operate with O(N) complexity relative to active parts and maintain 60 FPS.
-   **NFR-MAINT:** Enforce a clear separation of concerns between logic, UI, and services.
-   **NFR-TEST:** Core logic must be unit-testable without a live DOM, with a minimum of 80% test coverage.
-   **NFR-DATA:** All game content must be loaded from external, validated JSON files.
-   **NFR-SEC:** Sanitize user input, validate save data, and use secure OAuth 2.0 for Google Drive.
-   **NFR-ACC:** Support keyboard navigation and use appropriate ARIA labels.

## 7. Development Policies

### 7.1. Technical Debt and Deprecation
The project favors data migration over perpetual backward compatibility to reduce complexity.
-   **Guiding Principle:** The **Services Layer** is responsible for transforming any legacy data formats (e.g., old save files) into the current, canonical version *before* the data is passed to the Core Logic Layer. The Core layer must only ever deal with the current data format.
-   **Deprecation Process:** Legacy code must be isolated, documented with a sunset period, and completely removed after that period.
-   **Anti-Patterns to Remove:** Actively refactor fallback logic for data structures, backward compatibility shims in core logic, and duplicate implementations.

### 7.2. Logging
A centralized logger is attached to the game object (`game.logger`) to reduce console noise and improve user experience.
-   **Default Level:** The default logging level is `WARN` to minimize console output in production.
-   **Usage:** Components should use `this.game.logger?.debug()`, `info()`, `warn()`, and `error()` for logging.
-   **Console Controls:** Users can control the logging verbosity via functions available in the browser console (e.g., `setDebug()`, `setInfo()`).
