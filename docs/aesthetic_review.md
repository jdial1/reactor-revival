# Reactor Revival: Aesthetic and Theme Review

## Art Style: "Brutalist Pixel Industrial"
Reactor Revival employs a deliberate 8-bit retro-pixel aesthetic that emphasizes clarity and technical function.

- **Typography:** Uses the iconic "Press Start 2P" font, reinforcing the retro/classic hardware feel.
- **Visual Language:** Relies on high-contrast, clean-lined pixel art for all game components (cells, vents, valves).
- **Interface:** A "Brutalist" UI inspired by BIOS screens and industrial control panels. It features dark, recessed "inset wells" and elevated "bevel panels" to create a tactile, hardware-focused experience.
- **Color Palette:** Dominated by dark slate and charcoal (`rgb(38 38 38)`), punctuated by functional neon highlights:
    - **Green:** Success, growth, and currency (`rgb(93 156 81)`).
    - **Amber/Orange:** Warnings and heat management (`rgb(255 160 0)`).
    - **Red:** Critical danger and meltdown states (`rgb(171 63 63)`).
    - **Blue:** Primary actions and energy flow (`rgb(81 93 156)`).
- **Micro-interactions:** The UI is brought to life with snappy, physics-inspired animations (pops, glows, and jitters) that provide immediate tactile feedback for every user action.

## Overall Theme: "Nuclear Systems Optimization"
The game is a technical incremental simulator focused on the precision management of nuclear energy.

- **Core Concept:** Optimization of complex industrial systems through efficiency tuning and strategic component placement.
- **Vibe:** A serious but satisfying engineering simulation that blends the "low-tech" feel of 90s hardware with "high-tech" nuclear concepts.
- **Progression:** An incremental loop of building, exploding (meltdowns), researching, and optimizing, heavily inspired by the technical depth of *IndustrialCraft²*.
