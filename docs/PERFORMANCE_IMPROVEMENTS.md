# Performance Improvements - Engine.js

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations and improvements made to the engine.js file to reduce console spam, improve performance monitoring, and optimize game engine operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Performance Logging Cleanup ✅
- **Reduced console spam**: Changed performance report frequency from every 30 seconds to every 2 minutes
- **Quiet mode by default**: Enabled quiet mode to reduce excessive "All operations < 1ms average" messages
- **Improved thresholds**: Increased performance thresholds from 1ms to 2ms average and 10ms to 15ms max to reduce noise
- **Smart messaging**: Quiet messages now only show every 5 minutes instead of every report cycle

### 2. Performance Measurement Optimization ✅
- **Conditional measurements**: All performance measurements now only run when performance monitoring is enabled
- **Convenience method**: Added `shouldMeasure()` method to simplify performance check logic
- **Reduced overhead**: Performance measurements no longer run in production builds unless explicitly enabled
- **Consistent API**: All performance calls now use `shouldMeasure()` method for consistency

### 3. Engine Loop Optimizations ✅
- **Eliminated unnecessary measurements**: Performance measurements are now properly guarded
- **Improved caching**: Added comprehensive caching for valve neighbors, heat transfers, and power calculations
- **Memory management**: Added periodic cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Granular measurements**: Added detailed performance tracking for each engine operation:
  - `tick_heat_transfer` (overall heat transfer)
  - `tick_inlets` (heat inlets processing)
  - `tick_valves` (valve processing)
  - `tick_exchangers` (heat exchanger processing)
  - `tick_outlets` (heat outlet processing)
  - `tick_particle_accelerators` (particle accelerator processing)
  - `tick_explosions` (explosion checking)
  - `tick_vents` (vent processing)

### 4. Cache System Improvements ✅
- **Multiple cache layers**: 
  - `_valveNeighborCache`: Caches valve neighbor tiles for efficient lookup
  - Pre-allocated arrays for active parts with size limits
- **Automatic cleanup**: Caches are automatically maintained and updated when needed
- **Size limits**: Arrays are pre-allocated with reasonable upper bounds (100 for cells/vessels, 50 for exchangers, 20 for inlets/outlets)

### 5. Visual Event Optimization ✅
- **Pre-allocated buffers**: Visual event arrays are pre-allocated to reduce garbage collection
- **Buffer size**: Increased from 100 to 200 events to handle complex reactor layouts
- **Efficient indexing**: Uses index-based array access instead of push operations

### 6. Part Cache Optimization ✅
- **Single-pass grid scanning**: Efficiently categorizes all parts in one grid traversal
- **Switch-based categorization**: Uses switch statements for better performance than multiple if statements
- **Early exits**: Skips empty tiles immediately to reduce processing overhead
- **Array trimming**: Pre-allocates arrays and trims to actual size for memory efficiency

## Performance Impact

### Before
- Console flooded with performance messages every 30 seconds
- All operations measured regardless of performance monitoring status
- No caching for expensive calculations
- Memory leaks from unbounded caches
- Small visual event buffer causing potential overflow
- Inefficient part categorization with multiple array traversals

### After
- Clean, informative performance reports every 2 minutes
- Performance measurements only run when needed
- Comprehensive caching reduces redundant calculations
- Automatic memory management prevents leaks
- Reduced garbage collection from pre-allocated buffers
- Efficient single-pass part categorization
- Larger visual event buffer for complex layouts

## Usage

### Enabling Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Only enabled in debug/test environments
game.performance.enable();
```

### Checking Performance Status
```javascript
const status = game.performance.getStatus();
console.log('Performance monitoring:', status.enabled);
console.log('Quiet mode:', status.quietMode);
```

### Manual Performance Summary
```javascript
game.performance.logPerformanceSummary();
```

## Configuration

### Performance Thresholds
- **Display interval**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **Quiet message interval**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Significant operation thresholds**: >2ms average, >15ms max, >50 count

### Cache Limits
- **Maximum array sizes**: 
  - Cells/Vessels: 100
  - Exchangers: 50
  - Inlets/Outlets: 20
- **Visual events buffer**: 200 events
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup and size management

## Best Practices

1. **Performance monitoring is disabled by default** - only enable when debugging
2. **Use quiet mode** for production environments to reduce console noise
3. **Monitor cache sizes** - large caches indicate potential memory issues
4. **Regular cleanup** - caches are automatically maintained but can be manually cleared if needed
5. **Consistent measurement calls** - always use `shouldMeasure()` method for performance checks

## Future Improvements

- **Adaptive thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds based on system performance
- **Performance profiling**: Detailed breakdown of engine operations
- **Memory profiling**: Track memory usage and garbage collection
- **Real-time monitoring**: WebSocket-based performance dashboard
- **Object pooling**: Reuse visual event objects to reduce garbage collection
- **Web Workers**: Move heavy calculations to background threads
- **GPU acceleration**: Use WebGL for visual effects rendering
