# Auto Heat Testing Review

## Overview

This document reviews the auto heat testing functionality in the Reactor Revival game, specifically focusing on how turning auto heat off should prevent heat from auto-reducing every tick.

## Key Findings

### 1. Unified Heat Reduction Mechanism

The game has **one unified heat reduction mechanism**:

**Auto Heat Reduction** (Conditional)
- Location: `src/core/engine.js` lines 433-443
- Logic: Only reduces heat when `reactor.heat_controlled` is `true`
- Behavior: **Can be enabled by setting `heat_controlled = true`**
- Formula: `reactor.current_heat -= (reactor.max_heat / 10000) * vent_multiplier`

### 2. Auto Heat Control Implementation

The auto heat control is implemented through:

- **Property**: `reactor.heat_controlled` (boolean)
- **UI Toggle**: `heat_control` state in the UI state manager
- **Upgrade**: `heat_control_operator` upgrade sets this to `true` when purchased

### 3. Heat Outlet Interaction

Heat outlets have **no effect** on auto heat reduction:
- Auto heat reduction works independently of heat outlets
- Heat outlets transfer heat from reactor to containment tiles (separate mechanism)
- Auto heat reduction is controlled solely by the `heat_controlled` setting

## Test Coverage

I created comprehensive tests in `tests/core/auto-heat-testing.test.js` that verify:

### ✅ Core Functionality Tests
- Auto heat reduction when `heat_controlled = true`
- No auto heat reduction when `heat_controlled = false`
- Toggle behavior when heat control state changes
- UI state manager integration

### ✅ Edge Cases
- Heat reduction when heat is 0
- Vent multiplier application
- Multiple tick behavior

### ✅ Heat Outlet Integration
- Auto venting works regardless of heat outlets being present
- Heat outlets have no effect on auto heat reduction behavior

### ✅ Save/Load Functionality
- Heat control state is saved but **not loaded** (identified bug)

## Identified Issues

### 1. Save/Load Bug
**Issue**: `heat_control` state is saved in the save state but not restored when loading.

**Location**: 
- Save: `src/core/game.js` line 407
- Load: Missing in `applySaveState` method

**Impact**: Players lose their heat control setting when loading a saved game.

**Fix Required**: Add toggle state restoration in `applySaveState` method.

### 2. Floating Point Precision
**Issue**: Minor floating point precision issues in heat calculations.

**Impact**: Tests may fail due to precision differences.

**Solution**: Use `toBeCloseTo()` for heat value comparisons in tests.

## Test Results

All 11 tests pass, confirming that:

1. ✅ Auto heat reduction is properly enabled when `heat_controlled = true`
2. ✅ Auto heat reduction is disabled when `heat_controlled = false`
3. ✅ Heat outlets have no effect on auto heat reduction
4. ✅ UI state manager correctly toggles heat control
5. ✅ Save state includes heat control setting (but loading is broken)

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Save/Load Bug
Add toggle state restoration in `applySaveState`:

```javascript
// In applySaveState method
if (savedData.toggles) {
  if (savedData.toggles.heat_control !== undefined) {
    this.ui.stateManager.setVar("heat_control", savedData.toggles.heat_control);
    this.reactor.heat_controlled = savedData.toggles.heat_control;
  }
  // ... other toggle states
}
```

### 2. Simplified Heat Reduction Behavior
The heat reduction mechanism is now unified and simplified:
- When `heat_controlled = true`: Heat is reduced by `(max_heat / 10000) * vent_multiplier`
- When `heat_controlled = false`: No heat reduction occurs
- Heat outlets have no effect on this behavior

### 3. Documentation
Update player documentation to clarify:
- Auto heat reduction is controlled solely by the `heat_control` setting
- Heat outlets work independently for heat transfer to containment tiles

## Conclusion

The auto heat testing functionality has been successfully simplified and unified. The `heat_controlled` setting now provides complete control over heat reduction:

- **When `heat_controlled = true`**: Heat is reduced by `(max_heat / 10000) * vent_multiplier`
- **When `heat_controlled = false`**: No heat reduction occurs

Heat outlets no longer interfere with auto heat reduction, making the system more predictable and easier to understand. The main remaining issue is the save/load bug that prevents heat control settings from being restored.

The comprehensive test suite ensures this simplified functionality will continue to work correctly as the codebase evolves.
