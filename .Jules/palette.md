## 2024-05-23 - Range Input Feedback
**Learning:** Range inputs (sliders) often lack immediate feedback about their precise value, relying on visual approximation. Adding a live-updating text readout (like a percentage) next to the slider significantly improves precision and user confidence without cluttering the UI.
**Action:** Always pair range inputs with a dynamic text readout element (like span) that updates on the input event.
