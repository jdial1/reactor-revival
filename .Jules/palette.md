## 2026-01-17 - Icon-Only Buttons Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like settings, account, close) are a common accessibility gap. Adding `aria-label` provides necessary context for screen readers that would otherwise just announce "button" or the emoji/icon name if available.
**Action:** When creating or modifying icon-only buttons, always ensure a descriptive `aria-label` is present, even if a `title` attribute exists. The `title` helps mouse users (tooltip), while `aria-label` helps screen reader users.
